WIFI & Lenovo & Linux

Some Lenovos have issues with the UEFI but cw struggles with linux.
In this case you have to change out the grub2 bootloader in ubuntu for grub legacy.

Another problem with some Lenovos is the wireless

# systemctl stop NetworkManager
# rmmod acer_wmi
# modprobe acer_wmi
# rfkill
# rfkill unblock all
# rfkill
# systemctl start NetworkManager
# rmmod -f acer_wmi

Then to get the settings to stick after reboot type
# sudo echo "blacklist acer_wmi" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

and you will have working WIFI.
