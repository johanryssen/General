Remove old kernels

(1) View all installed kernel packages:
# rpm -q kernel

(2) View kernels nut currently in use:
# rpm -q kernel | grep -v `uname -r`
## These are the ones available for removal
## Warning: Do not remove the kernel the system is currently running on.

(3) Remove the kernel package:
# rpm -e <package_name>

(4) Note: yum can download and install new kernels on a registered system.
However, it will leave the old kernels in place. You can manually remove them if you choose, although it is recommended to keep at least two kernels installed: the most current one and at least one older version that is known to work for your system.

(5) -Optional- MAke changes to the grub loader:
sed -i 's/GRUB_TIMEOUT=5/GRUB_TIMEOUT=2/g' /etc/default/grub
vim /etc/default/grub # e.g. set GRUB_TIMEOUT=2
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

(6) Reboot
