# You should not need the proxy configuration in --> Administer --> Settings --> HTTP(s) Proxy
Take a screenshot of that page and then nullify that value.

# If the proxy password has been changed, then:

1. Manually update /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf

2. Update proxy_password for satellite server, using satellite-installer:
satellite-installer -S satellite --katello-proxy-password='proxy_password'

3. Verify these files contain correct and identical proxy information:
/etc/pulp/server/plugins.conf.d/*.json
/etc/foreman/plugins/katello.yaml
/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf

# Explanation:
Infrastructure > HTTP Proxies > MyProxy > click "Test Connection" for https://aws.amazon.com > it works.
But for https://cdn.redhat.com
it fails with:
SSL_connect error "certificate verify failed (self signed certificate in chain)"

--> This is expected.
--> cdn.redhat.com requires additional CA and certificates while trying to do a connection test,
but the GUI method does not performs the test connection in that way.
It directly hits the URL via the proxy, without any other options and hence the SSL error is returned.

# Restart satellite services 
satellite-maintain service restart

# verify the proxy details on the mentioned files
/etc/pulp/server/plugins.conf.d/*.json
/etc/foreman/plugins/katello.yaml
/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf

# Test sync one Red Hat and a custom repo.
