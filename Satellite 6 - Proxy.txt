# You should not need the proxy configuration in --> Administer --> Settings --> HTTP(s) Proxy
Take a screenshot of that page and then nullify that value.

# If the proxy password has been changed, then:

1. Manually update /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf

2. Update proxy_password for satellite server, using satellite-installer:
satellite-installer -S satellite --katello-proxy-password='proxy_password'

3. Verify these files contain correct and identical proxy information:
/etc/pulp/server/plugins.conf.d/*.json
/etc/foreman/plugins/katello.yaml
/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf

# Explanation:
Infrastructure > HTTP Proxies > MyProxy > click "Test Connection" for https://aws.amazon.com > it works.
But for https://cdn.redhat.com
it fails with:
SSL_connect error "certificate verify failed (self signed certificate in chain)"

--> This is expected.
--> cdn.redhat.com requires additional CA and certificates while trying to do a connection test,
but the GUI method does not performs the test connection in that way.
It directly hits the URL via the proxy, without any other options and hence the SSL error is returned.

# Restart satellite services 
satellite-maintain service restart
satellite-maintain service status

# verify the proxy details on the mentioned files
/etc/pulp/server/plugins.conf.d/*.json
/etc/foreman/plugins/katello.yaml
/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf

# Test sync one Red Hat and a custom repo.

# CLI - Test the connectivity of custom repos:
unset http_proxy
unset https_proxy
curl -vvv --proxy-user proxyUser:S0mePasswd --proxy proxy.example.com:8080 https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/

--------------------

## Check the connectivity with cdn.redhat.com
ls -l /etc/pki/entitlement/*

# curl -vvv --proxy-user user:password --proxy _PROXY_IP_:8080 --cacert /etc/rhsm/ca/redhat-uep.pem --cert /etc/pki/entitlement/6576496576320934530.pem --key /etc/pki/entitlement/6576496576320934530-key.pem https://cdn.redhat.com/content/dist/rhel/server/7/7Server/x86_64/os/

NOTE:
The entitlement cert\key to be used comes from a consumed subscription and you need to keep one thing in mind that, the CDN URL you are trying to access should be of a REPO\PRODUCT that is being provided by the ENTITLEMENTS.

Tis curl command (to check connectivity to cdn/redhat repo sites) DOES NOT REQUIRE password authent at the proxy (still needs the proxy deets, ie. IP:port , just not user), so this works :

# curl -vvv --proxy _PROXY_IP_:8080  --cacert /etc/rhsm/ca/redhat-uep.pem --cert /etc/pki/entitlement/6576496576320934530.pem --key /etc/pki/entitlement/6576496576320934530-key.pem  https://cdn.redhat.com/content/dist/rhel/server/7/7Server/x86_64/os/

-or- 
# curl -vvv --proxy-user _USER:_PASSWORD --proxy _PROXY_IP_:8080 https://subscription.rhn.redhat.com --cacert /etc/rhsm/ca/redhat-uep.pem
