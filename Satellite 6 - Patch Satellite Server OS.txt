'yum update' and 'yum install' is blocked by the new feature 'foreman-protector'.

To update Satellite server OS:
# satellite-maintain packages update

--- old way ---
In order to do a full update such as yum update would do, you must unlock packages, do the update, and then lock the packages.
You will then need to also run the satellite-installer manually:

# satellite-maintain packages unlock
# yum update
# satellite-maintain packages lock
# satellite-installer --upgrade


==============

## Install/Update a package:
# satellite-maintain packages install package_name
-or-
# satellite-maintain packages update package_name
