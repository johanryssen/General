==============================================

(1) Access man pages from within vim:
# echo "source $(locate man.vim | grep ftplugin)" >> ~/.vimrc
** A file type plugin (ftplugin) is a script that is run automatically when 
	Vim detects the type of file when the file is created or opened.
** The type can be detected from the file name (for example, file sample. c has file type c ), 
	or from the file contents.

(2) Open a text file, e.g.
# vim /etc/selinux/config

(3) Access the corresponding man page:
:Man selinux
** Note the Capital "M" in :Man above.
