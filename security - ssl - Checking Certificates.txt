----- Checking certificate validity -----

Checking the basic validity of a certificate chain sent by a server

The example below shows a successfully verified certificate chain sent by a server (redhat.com) after a connection on port 443. 
"Verification" is output as "OK."


'openssl s_client' will read from standard input for data to send to the remote server.
Appending an echo sends a newline and immediately terminates the connection.
Without this, you would need to press Ctrl+C to quit the connection.


echo | openssl s_client -connect redhat.com:443 -brief
...
Verification: OK
...

-vs-

echo | openssl s_client -connect self-signed.badssl.com:443 -brief
...
Verification error: self signed certificate
...


----- Determining when a certificate expires -----

Piping the output into x509, you can obtain the certificate’s validity period by using the -dates flag.

# A valid certificate that hasn’t expired yet
$ echo | openssl s_client -connect redhat.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates
notBefore=Jul  9 00:00:00 2019 GMT
notAfter=Aug  2 12:00:00 2021 GMT

-vs-

# A certificate that expired in 2015
$ echo | openssl s_client -connect expired.badssl.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates
notBefore=Apr  9 00:00:00 2015 GMT
notAfter=Apr 12 23:59:59 2015 GMT
