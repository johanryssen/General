--------- EMAIL SENDING ---------

===========================
Null Client only SENDS email (i.e. Linux server + smtp)
Null Client --> Contains a Forwarder (to an smtp server) to send email.
===========================

/etc/postfix/main.cf

- inet_interfaces
inet_interfaces is set to localhost, and that means that your Postfix mail server won't accept any incoming messages.

netstat -tulpen | less

and in the list we see the master process, which is a part of the Postfix mail server and that is bound to 127.0.0.1, and that's localhost.
So, this mail server is not accessible from the outside.

- relayhost
To configure Postfix to relay messages to another host:
>> relayhost=[10.10.10.123] # name or IP address of your relayhost.

Place this name between square brackets, because then the Postfix mail server will not do a DNS MX mail server lookup, it will just send the message directly to the relayhost.



--------- EMAIL RECEIVING ---------

## inet_interfaces
### Change to:
>> inet_interfaces = all (to listen on all interfaces)

## myorigin
The myorigin parameter indicates where the message seems to be coming from.

### default value: myorigin = $myhostname
When user3 sends a message from server32.test.lab, the recipient will see a message coming in from:
user3@server32.test.lab

### Fix: Include the hostname in the myorigin parameter:
>> myorigin = $mydomain
This will make sure that only the domain part is used.
user3@test.lab


## relayhost
Comment out on MX server:
>> ## relayhost=[10.10.10.123]


## mynetworks
### Set to:
>> mynetworks = 10.10.10.0/24

The mynetworks parameter is a space separated list of networks that are allowed to relay.
To make sure that this host only relays for packages coming in from the LOCAL NETWORK, set it to the subnet of the LOCAL NETWORK.
### Note: This will disallow anybody from the internet to use this message as a relay host.
Now only users who have a VPN connection to your server and appear to be on the local network will be able to use it.

## inet_protocol

### Default:
inet_protocol = 'all' 
This means that this mail server will use IPv6, as well as IPv4.
But by default it will bind to IPv6, and that means that you need a completely working IPv6 configuration.
If you don't have that, make sure to change inet_protocols and set it to ipv4.

### set to:
>> inet_protocols = ipv4


********** MX / Mail server - config - BRIEF **********
myhostname = mx.test.lab
mydomain = test.lab
inet_interfaces = all
myorigin = $mydomain
## relayhost=[192.168.78.134]
mynetworks = 192.168.0.0/16
inet_protocols = ipv4

## When using /etc/hosts (and not DNS):
lmtp_host_lookup = native
smtp_host_lookup = native

-or-
disable_dns_lookups = yes

## Set fake hosts in /etc/hosts:
/etc/postfix/main.cf

smtp_dns_support_level = disabled
* http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_dns_support_level


************** smtp_dns_support_level ***************
*
*  (default: empty)
*  Level of DNS support in the Postfix SMTP client.
*  With "smtp_dns_support_level" left at its empty default value,
*  the legacy "disable_dns_lookups" parameter controls whether DNS is enabled in the Postfix SMTP client,
*  otherwise the legacy parameter is ignored.
*
* ## Specify one of the following >
*
* > disabled - Disable DNS lookups
* 
*  No MX lookups are performed and hostname to address lookups are unconditionally "native".
*  This setting is not appropriate for hosts that deliver mail to the public Internet.
*  Some obsolete how-to documents recommend disabling DNS lookups in some configurations with content_filters.
*  This is no longer required and strongly discouraged.
*
*
* > enabled - Enable DNS lookups.
*
*  Nexthop destination domains not enclosed in "[]" will be subject to MX lookups.
*  If "dns" and "native" are included in the "smtp_host_lookup" parameter value,
*  DNS will be queried first to resolve MX-host A records, followed by "native" lookups if no answer is found in DNS.
*
*
*> dnssec - Enable DNSSEC lookups.
*
* ## The "dnssec" setting differs from the "enabled" setting above in the following ways:
*  - Any MX lookups will set RES_USE_DNSSEC and RES_USE_EDNS0 to request DNSSEC-validated responses.
*    If the MX response is DNSSEC-validated the corresponding hostnames are considered validated.
*  - The address lookups of validated hostnames are also validated, (provided of course "smtp_host_lookup" includes "dns", see below).
*  - Temporary failures in DNSSEC-enabled hostname-to-address resolution block any "native" lookups.
*    Additional "native" lookups only happen when DNSSEC lookups hard-fail (NODATA or NXDOMAIN).
