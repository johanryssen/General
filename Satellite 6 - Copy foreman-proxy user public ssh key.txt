--- Copy foreman-proxy user public ssh key to many client systems for Remote Execution ---

## Issue
Setting up Satellite's Remote Execution feature requires copying the foreman-proxy user's public ssh key to the service accounts of all client systems.
This can be copied to systems individually using:

[Satellite #] ssh-copy-id -i ~foreman-proxy/.ssh/id_rsa_foreman_proxy.pub service_account@target.system

where service_account is the remote_execution_ssh_user as defined on the Satellite.

However this is not feasible to implement when there are many (dozens, hundreds, thousands) of hosts that need to have the ssh keys copied -- how can this operation be performed on larger environments?

## Resolution
Clients can retrieve the key by executing the curl command: 

[Client_System #] curl https://satellite.example.com:9090/ssh/pubkey >> ~service_account/.ssh/authorized_keys

where satellite.example.com is the Satellite FQDN and service_account (e.g. rexuser) is the service account on the target machine.

What is needed to form a complete solution is a method to execute the above curl command on all target machines, and this needs to be done in batches to avoid DDoSing the Satellite server.

Ansible's shell module is the perfect tool for this job.

1. Install Ansible to a Linux system that has network/ssh access to all target machines.
For RHEL7, Ansible is contained in rhel-7-server-extras-rpms repo and can be installed with:
yum install ansible.

2. cd into the Ansible installation directory (by default this is /etc/ansible) and create a hosts file, which should look like:
service_account@target_system_1
service_account@target_system_2
service_account@target_system_3

3. Execute the command using Ansible's shell module, against all hosts in the hosts file, using the options:
--ask-pass (we are using password authentication since we have not yet copied ssh keys) and 
-f 1 (execute on each host one at a time, to avoid DDoSing Satellite).

# ansible -m shell -a 'curl https://satellite.example.com:9090/ssh/pubkey >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys' all --ask-pass -f 1

You will be prompted for a password to log in to the service_account on the target systems.
Then you will see output indicating whether the operation was successful or failed for each target system.

4. If the operation failed on any system, investigate why, resolve any issues, and re-run the command for those systems.
Eg. if a target system does not have the service_account, if the service_account password is different on some target system, if some target system is not listening on port 22 or cannot be reached by the machine running Ansible.


## Root Cause
There is no way to script a mass # ssh-copy-id operation from the Satellite since # ssh-copy-id is not able to receive passwords from stdin
(this is by design, since it would be a security risk to have plaintext passwords floating around in any machine's bash history).
