Customizing Red Hat Enterprise Linux System-Wide Crypto Policy

--- 1 MODIFY THE FUTURE CRYPTO POLICY ---

The Chief Security Officer sends out the following e-mail:

---------------
Application and Infrastructure Administrators,

After my last e-mail recommending 3072 bit public keys, I have received few 
concerns that some applications would need additional time for migration.

To continue supporting these applications running on our platform, and 
to provide more time for these applications to upgrade, my recommendation 
is to disallow TLS (1.0, and 1.1), and not allow SHA-1 hash usage.

**NOTE** We should still allow 2048 bit ciphers usage for a certain period of 
time until all applications can be upgraded to use 3072 bit keys.

-CSO
---------------

In order to comply with the requirements set forth by the CSO above, you will update the system to modify the FUTURE policy to support shorter keys of 2048 bit length.

By default, the minimum key length in the FUTURE policy is set to 3072-bit.

# Check the currently active crypto policy in effect on the system:
update-crypto-policies --show

# Check the status of the Apache service:
systemctl status httpd.service --no-pager

The Apache service has failed to start.

# You can also try restarting the Apache service:
systemctl restart httpd.service

The Apache service fails to restart.

# You can see a more specific error message in the SSL error log for Apache:
tail -2 /var/log/httpd/ssl_error_log

[Tue Jul 16 15:13:25.580860 2019 ] [ssl:emerg] [pid 8869:tid 140233336588544] SSL Library Error: error: 140AB18F: SSL routines: SSL_CTX_use_certificate:ee key too small
The error message indicates that the key length was too small which was expected because the FUTURE policy requires a minimum of 3072-bit keys.


# Create a POLICY MODIFIER MODULE called 2048KEYS.pmod that can be used with the FUTURE crypto policy.

Policy modifiers are text files that include policy instructions to the update-crypto-policies tool.

The naming of these files must follow the following convention:
MODULE.pmod
- where MODULE is the name of the modifier in uppercase without spaces
- .pmod is the file extension in lowercase.

# Create a policy modifier called 2048KEYS.pmod that will set the minimum key size to 2048 bits.
touch /etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/2048KEYS.pmod

# In the policy modifier file, specify the minimum key size of RSA and DH keys:
echo "min_dh_size = 2048" > /etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/2048KEYS.pmod
echo "min_rsa_size = 2048" >> /etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/2048KEYS.pmod

# Configure the system to use a modified FUTURE policy with our newly created policy modifier:
update-crypto-policies --set FUTURE:2048KEYS

If you want to apply multiple policy modifiers, you can chain together several policy modifiers separated using ':'.

The policy modifiers are evaluated left to right to modify the specified named policy.

Setting system policy to FUTURE:2048KEYS
Note: System-wide crypto policies are applied on application start-up.
It is recommended to restart the system for the change to policies to fully take place.

# Verify that the new policy has been applied to the system.
update-crypto-policies --show
FUTURE:2048KEYS


--- 2 RECONCILE SERVICE ISSUES ---

Restart the Apache service after changing the system-wide crypto policy so that it runs under the new policy.
NOTE: Red Hat recommends rebooting the system for all services to be initialized with the new cryptographic policy.
systemctl restart httpd.service

# Verify that Apache is running on the machine.
systemctl status httpd.service --no-pager
...
Active: active (running) since Monday 2019-07-15 19:24:18 EDT; 3h 59min left

# Now that the service is running and certificates used comply with the modified FUTURE policy that supports shorter key lengths, connect to the Apache service and validate the bit length of the certificate is being offered to client browsers.

openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep '^Server public key'
Server public key is 2048 bit

You have now configured RHEL to enforce a modified FUTURE crypto policy that can support 2048-bit or higher ciphers.

Due to this setup, Apache server can continue to run using a 2048-bit server key.
