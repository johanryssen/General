## Using AD as an external authentication source

- Satellite must be joined to the target domain.

- To enable single sign on using HTTPD it is required to create an SPN against the computer account on which Satellite runs.

- The resulting keytab must be deployed to /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.keytab.

- Once in place the HTTPD and GSSPROXY services must be configured to use the keytab when authenticating users and Satellite foreman will be enabled for external authentication.
