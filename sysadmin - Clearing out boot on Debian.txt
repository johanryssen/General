Clearing out /boot on Debian

Check /boot

df -h /boot
/dev/sda1       228M  219M     0 100% /boot

See all the old kernels and images:
ls -l /boot

It is not advisable just to delete them, as you can break your system.

Get your current kernel version:
uname -r

List installed kernels & exclude the one currently in use:
dpkg --list "linux-image*" | grep -v $(uname) | grep ii

Refine the output further:
dpkg --list "linux-image*" | grep -v $(uname -r) | grep ii | awk '{ print $2 }'

NB: Ensure the kernel you are using is not in the list.

Now remove the old kernels:
sudo dpkg --purge $(dpkg --list "linux-image*" | grep -v $(uname -r) | grep ii | awk '{ print $2 }')

NB: Update grub with the available kernels:
update-grub2

Fix aptitude:
apt-get -f install

Clear the images out of aptitude:
apt-get autoremove 

Run df -h /boot again to see the free space.
