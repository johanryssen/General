Magic SysRq Key

Linux is very stable, but sometimes a kernel panic could happen, sometimes this stops the X-server and you cant change to the console.
What should be done? Hitting the reset button and risk filesystem integrity?

NO! There is a possibility to shut down the system cleanly or find out the source of the kernel panic.

For this purpose there is a kernel option called "Magic SysRQ Key" in the section kernel hacking.

If this option is enabled you can use a set of keyboard commands.

Alt+SysRq+r takes keyboard and mouse control from the X server.

This can be useful if the X-Server crashed, you can change to a console and kill the X-Server or check the error log.

Alt+SysRQ+k kills all processes on the current terminal.
Its a bad idea to do this on a console where X is running.
The graphic will stop and you cant see what you type.


Alt+SysRQ+b is like a reset: a reboot without umounting or sync.
Alt+SysRQ+o shuts down via APM.
Alt+SysRQ+s writes all data from the disc cache to the harddiscs, its a sync.
Alt+SysRQ+u remounts all mounted filesystem readonly.
After using this key, you can reboot the system with Alt+SysRQ+b without harming the system.
Alt+SysRQ+m prints memory information to the console.
Alt+SysRQ+e sends SIGTERM to all processes except init.
Alt+SysRQ+i sends SIGKILL to all processes except init.
Alt+SysRQ+l sends SIGKILL to all processes, inclusive init.
(The system is not working after using this.)

To shut down the system after a really bad kernel panic, do the following:
Alt+SysRQ+e (sends TERM-signal, processes can shutdown properly (e.g. save data))
Alt+SysRQ+u (a sync will be done when unmounting anyway)
Alt+SysRQ+i (for the processes that didn't listen for the TERM signal, this is a kill -9 process)
Alt+SysRQ+b (reboot).

To be able to use the SysRq feature, you need to do

echo "1" > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq

or add an entry to /etc/sysctl.
conf:

kernel.
sysrq = 1
