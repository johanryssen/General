# Add rules to /usr/local/etc/pf.conf


## Check rules:
service pf check


## Reading the Log File
# To view the log file:
tcpdump -n -e -ttt -r /var/log/pflog

# View real-time display of logged packets:
tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog0


## Filtering Log Output
# IP:
tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog0 host 10.10.10.123

# Port:
tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog0 port 80

# host and port combination:
tcpdump -n -e -ttt -r /var/log/pflog port 80 and host 10.10.10.123

## The tcpdump filter language has been extended for reading pflogd output:

ip - address family is IPv4.
ip6 - address family is IPv6.
on int - packet passed through the interface int.
ifname int - same as on int.
ruleset name - the ruleset/anchor that the packet was matched in.
rulenum num - the filter rule that the packet matched was rule number num.
action act - the action taken on the packet. Possible actions are pass and block.
reason res - the reason that action was taken. Possible reasons are match, bad-offset, fragment, short, normalize, memory, bad-timestamp, congestion, ip-option, proto-cksum, state-mismatch, state-insert, state-limit, src-limit and synproxy.
inbound - packet was inbound.
outbound - packet was outbound. 

# Examples:
# Display the log, in real-time, of inbound packets that were BLOCKED on the vtnet0 interface.
tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog0 inbound and action block and on vtnet0

# Display the log, in real-time, of inbound packets that were allowed (PASS) on the vtnet0 interface.
tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog0 inbound and action pass and on vtnet0
