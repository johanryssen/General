--- email Sending ---

/etc/postfix/main.cf

- inet_interfaces
inet_interfaces is set to localhost, and that means that your Postfix mail server won't accept any incoming messages.

netstat -tulpen | less

and in the list we see the master process, which is a part of the Postfix mail server and that is bound to 127.0.0.1, and that's localhost.
So, this mail server is not accessible from the outside.

- relayhost
To configure Postfix to relay messages to another host:

relayhost=[10.10.10.123] # name or IP address of your relayhost.

Place this name between square brackets, because then the Postfix mail server will not do a DNS MX mail server lookup, it will just send the message directly to the relayhost.


*** Test sending ***
# mail user3@mydomain.com
Subject: Test email message
This is a test message.
EOT
********************



--- email Receiving ---

## inet_interfaces
### Change to:
inet_interfaces = all (to listen on all interfaces)


## myorigin
The myorigin parameter indicates where the message seems to be coming from.

### default value:
myorigin = $myhostname

But if user3 sends a message from server32.example.com, the recipient will see a message coming in from:
user3@server32.example.com

### Fix: Include the hostname in the myorigin parameter:
myorigin = $mydomain
This will make sure that only the domain part is used.


## relayhost
Set it to the host to which you want to forward the e-mail message.
relayhost=[10.10.10.123]  # name or IP address of your relayhost.


## mynetworks
### Set to:
mynetworks = 10.10.10.0/24

The mynetworks parameter is a space separated list of networks that are allowed to relay.

To make sure that this host only relays for packages coming in from the LOCAL NETWORK, set it to the IP address of the LOCAL NETWORK

### Note: This will disallow anybody from the internet to use this message as a relay host.
Now only users who have a VPN connection to your server and appear to be on the local network will be able to use it.


## inet_protocol

### Default:
inet_protocol = 'all' 
This means that this mail server will use IPv6, as well as IPv4.
But by default it will bind to IPv6, and that means that you need a completely working IPv6 configuration.
If you don't have that, make sure to change inet_protocols and set it to ipv4.

### set to:
inet_protocols = ipv4
