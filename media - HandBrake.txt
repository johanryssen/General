HANDBRAKE

Remove the 'Release' HandBrake and install HandBrake-SnapShot (More options, eg. MP4)

apt-get remove handbrake-gtk handbrake-cli
add-apt-repository ppa:stebbins/handbrake-snapshots
apt-get update
apt-get install handbrake-gtk handbrake-cli

=========================

avconv -i input.mkv -codec copy output.mp4

=========================

apt-get install gpac mkvtoolnix

=========================
-- FFMPEG --
To convert all the mkv files in current directory, run a simple loop in terminal:

for i in $(ls *mkv); do ffmpeg -i $i -vcodec copy -acodec copy $i.mp4; done;

=========================
-- VLC --
Download and install VLC player with one of the options provided here:
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ubuntu.html

Then run it by executing this command in Terminal:

vlc

Then once the program is open go "Media > Convert / Save...":

"Media > Convert / Save..." option

And in this interface which comes up click the "Add" button and locate the MP4 file which
you wish to convert:

Open Media window

Then select the "Convert / Save" option at the bottom which now becomes enabled (not
greyed out). Next select the profile "Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4)" and then click on the
little tool icon next to the pull-down menu and make sure that the option "MKV" is
selected and not the default "MP4/MOV" like this:

Profile edition options

Then click the "Save" button at the bottom left. Then select the destination to where you
want VLC player to export the file to and press "Start". Ignore any errors telling you
about encoding problems. The progress bar which normally shows how far into the program
you are will now show the progress of the conversion. When the progress bar has finished,
your video will have been converted and ready to play.

=========================
-- AVCONV --
Install avconv
sudo apt-get install libav-tools

Translate via command line

avconv -i filme.mp4 -c copy filme.mkv

Converting this way produces a file with a similar size.
We need do add extra options to define what transformations should be done to reduce
space. (See avconv -h)

=========================
-- AVIDEMUX --
Avidemux is a free video editor designed for simple cutting, filtering and encoding tasks.
It supports many file types, including AVI, DVD compatible MPEG files, MP4 and ASF, using
a variety of codecs. Tasks can be automated using projects, job queue and powerful
scripting capabilities.
Avidemux is available for Linux, BSD, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows under the GNU GPL
license. The program was written from scratch by Mean, but code from other people and
projects has been used as well.

1) Open the mkv file in avidemux and Select safe mode if prompted.

2) Leave the video as copy.

3) Choose File-> Properties. Check if the audio codec is aac.

4) If audio codec is NOT aac, select aac(faac).

Otherwise, leave it as copy. (Sometimes using this option the audio may be out of sync or
distorted, in that case select aac(faac) instead.)
Select mp4 for format.

5) Select save, choose location and type a filename with .mp4 as the extension.
