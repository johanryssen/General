Note: It is always recommended to take backup of your currently running satellite server then you can execute the above steps.

### Enable specific Red Hat repository on your register client
	# subscription-manager repos  --list
	# subscription-manager repos --enable={repository-id}

### Verify the subscription status of a RHEL Server in Satellite
	# subscription-manager status
	# Satellite dashboard > hosts > content hosts > subscription details.

### Ports used between satellite server
80 TCP – HTTP		(Provisioning)
443 TCP – HTTPS		(web access and api comms)
5646 / 5647 TCP		qdrouterd – (Client and Smart Proxy actions)
9090 TCP – HTTPS	(Comms with the Smart Proxy )

### Verify whether satellite server's service is up and running ?
	# katello-service status

### Agent installed on RHEL Servers for Red Hat Satellite
Katello-agent provides goferd service - used for patching

### What are Content Views and why they are used in Satellite Server ?
Content Views dictate what content is published into the repositories and therefore control what is made available to environment paths and their associated life cycle environments.

Content views are used to filter the contents of a repository like include or exclude packages / errata.
With the help of content views we can present the repositories to different environments (Dev, Test & Prod)

### Hammer CLI
Required package: "tfm-rubygem-hammer_cli_katello".
	# hammer -u <username> -p <password> <sub-commands>

## What is MANIFEST file in Red Hat Satellite and from where we can generate manifest file for Satellite Server ?
Manifest is a zipped file which contains list of subscriptions, subscription further defines Product and Content repositories.
In Red Hat satellite Server we have to import the manifest file then after Red Hat repositories will be visible in the satellite dashboard.
A manifest file for your satellite server can be generated using the following steps:
	a) Access your Red Hat Customer portal then go to 'All Subscription Management Applications'
	b) Click on Satellite subtab and then select Register your satellite Server, specify the name of organization that you want to create under the Name field and select version as Satellite 6.x and click on Register.
	c) Now attach subscriptions that you want to add to this organization and then download the manifest.

### Configure backup of your Red Hat Satellite Server
'katello-backup' used to configure backups

Online backup (incl repositories):
	# katello-backup --online-backup /opt/backup
Take lot of time because it will take the backup of all repositories, also make you have enough free space in your backup directory.

Online backup (exclude repositories):
	# katello-backup --skip-pulp /opt/backup
