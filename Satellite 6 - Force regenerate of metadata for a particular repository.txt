## To regenerate metadata for a repository:

1. WEB UI and navigate to Content --> Products.
2. Click on the Product Name to which the repository belongs to and this would list all the available repositories for the Product.
3. Now click on the repository name for which metadata needs to be re-generated, this will show more details of the repository.
4. In Satellite 6.5 or newer, click to "Select Action" button on top right, and select "Republish Repository Metadata". Wait until the task is completed and you are done.
