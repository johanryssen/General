Sending mail from a shell script

## Simple example ##
1. Redirect the output of one command to the mail command
#!/bin/bash
df -h | mail -s "Disk space report" user1@example.com

## Send two items of data ##
1. Get disk usage and memory usage
2. Write the data into a temporary file
3. Enter it all into the body of the mail being sent out
#!/bin/bash
df -h > /tmp/mail_report.log
free -m >> /tmp/mail_report.log
mail -s "Disk and Memory report" user1@example.com < /tmp/mail_report.log

## Send multiple data ##
1. As above, redirect output of several commands to the same directory (eg. /home/user1/files)
2. Create one archive file of the directory
3. Attached the archive file (-a) and send the email
#!/bin/bash
tar -zcf /tmp/backup.tar.gz /home/user1/files
echo | mutt -a /tmp/backup.tar.gz -s "Multiple reports" user1@example.com

# The echo at the start of the last line adds a blank into the body of the mail being set out.

#!/bin/bash
ip a | grep inet > /root/ip.out
#
@reboot echo | mutt -i /root/ip.out -s "My IP" someone@example.com
#
exit 0
