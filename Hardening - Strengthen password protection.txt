Strengthen password protection

Implementing a strong password policy is an important aspect of keeping a server secure from cyberattacks and data breaches. Some best practices for password policies include enforcing a minimum length and specifying password age. I use the libpam-cracklib package to accomplish these tasks.

Install the libpam-cracklib package:

sudo apt-get install libpam-cracklib

# Enforce password length:

Open the /etc/pam.d/common-password file.
Change the minimum character length of all passwords by changing the minlen=12 line to however many characters you want.

# Prevent password reuse:

In the same file (/etc/pam.d/common-password), add the line remember=x.
For example, if you want to prevent a user from reusing one of their last five passwords, use: remember=5.

# Enforce password age:

Find the following lines in the /etc/login.defs file and replace them with your preferred amount of time (days). For example:

PASS_MIN_AGE: 3
PASS_MAX_AGE: 90
PASS_WARN_AGE: 14

# To enforce character specifications:

The four parameters to enforce character specifications in passwords are:
lcredit (lowercase)
ucredit (uppercase)
dcredit (digit)
ocredit (other characters).

In the same file (/etc/pam.d/common-password), locate the line containing pam_cracklib.so.
Add the following to the end of this line:

lcredit=-a ucredit=-b dcredit=-c ocredit=-d

For example, the following line requires passwords to contain one of each parameter. You can change the numbers based on your preferred level of password security:

lcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1
