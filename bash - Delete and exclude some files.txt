* – matches zero or more characters
? – matches any single character
[seq] – matches any character in seq
[!seq] – matches any character not in seq


--- rm ---

1. Enable extglob shell option:
shopt -s extglob

2. Options to delete:

## Delete all files in a directory except myFile:
rm -v !("myFile")

## Delete all files with the exception of myFile1 and myFile2:
rm -v !("myFile1"|"myFile2") 

## Delete all files other than all .zip files interactively:
rm -i !(*.zip)

## Delete all files apart from all .zip and .odt files:
rm -v !(*.zip|*.odt)

3. When done, turn off the extglob shell option:
shopt -u extglob



--- find ---

find /directory/ -type f -not -name 'PATTERN' -delete
find /directory/ -type f -not -name 'PATTERN' -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} rm {}
find /directory/ -type f -not -name 'PATTERN' -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} rm [options] {}

## Delete all files apart from .gz files in the current directory:
find . -type f -not -name '*.gz'-delete

## Using a pipeline and xargs, you can modify the case above as follows:
find . -type f -not -name '*gz' -print0 | xargs -0  -I {} rm -v {}

## Delete all files excluding .gz, .odt, and .jpg files in the current directory:
find . -type f -not \(-name '*gz' -or -name '*odt' -or -name '*.jpg' \) -delete

*** BASH only ***

## cd to directory containing files to be deleted:
cd test

## Set GLOBIGNORE variable:
GLOBIGNORE=*.odt:*.iso:*.txt

## Remove all files in current directory:
rm -v *

## When done:
