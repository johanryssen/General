Debugging an SSL connection
===========================
Imagine you would like to debug an SSL connection to a box, for example HTTPS.
Using telnet or netcat, you are not able to do so, but openssl makes this possible:

## FIRST - connect to a machine:
$ openssl s_client -connect mail.google.com:443

# You will be given the certificate details:
	CONNECTED(00000003)
	depth=2 /C=US/O=VeriSign, Inc./OU=Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority
	verify return:1

	...

	   Krb5 Principal: None
	   Start Time: 1264674178
	   Timeout   : 300 (sec)
	   Verify return code: 0 (ok)
	---

# SECOND -  Enter commands in plain text, just as you would using telnet or netcat:
HEAD / HTTP/1.0

# Here is what you get:
	HTTP/1.0 302 Found
	Cache-Control: private
	Location: http://www.google.com
	Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
	Content-Length: 218
	Date: Thu, 28 Jan 2010 10:23:05 GMT
	Server: GFE/2.0
	X-XSS-Protection: 0

	read:errno=0

# Can also be used to connect to SSL-ed STMP connections, IMAPS, POP3S, etc.
