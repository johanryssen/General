# virsh net-update

Some changes to the network configuration (including addition of a static MAC+IP mapping for DHCP) can be done with "virsh net-update", which can be told to enact the changes immediately.

Eg. Add a DHCP static host entry to the network named "default" mapping MAC address 53:54:00:00:01 to IP address 192.168.122.45 and hostname "bob", you could use this command:

    virsh net-update default add ip-dhcp-host \
          "<host mac='52:54:00:00:00:01' \
           name='bob' ip='192.168.122.45' />" \
           --live --config

Along with the "add" subcommand, virsh net-update also has a "delete" sub-command as well as "modify" (for some items), "add-first", and "add-last".

The config items in a network that can be changed with virsh net-update are:

   ip-dhcp-host
   ip-dhcp-range (add/delete only, no modify)
   forward-interface (add/delete only)
   portgroup
   dns-host
   dns-txt
   dns-srv

In each case, the final argument on the commandline (aside from "--live --config") should be the XML section that you want to add/modify or delete.
For example, the proper XML for 
"virsh net-update default add forward-interface"
would be something like
"<interface dev='eth20'/>"

(note the careful use of quotes - due to the XML containing spaces and shell redirection characters, you must put quotes around the entire XML snippet, but this means that any quotes within the XML must either be single quotes, or be escaped with a backslash.)
