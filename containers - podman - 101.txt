----- NETWORKING -----
Differences in networking between ROOTLESS and ROOTFULL containers.

--- Podman pods ---
By definition, all containers in the same Podman pod share the same network namespace.
Therefore, the containers will share the IP Address, MAC Addresses and port mappings.
You can always communicate between containers in the same pod, using localhost.

##### ROOTLESS NETWORKING #####
When using Podman as a rootless user, the network is setup automatically.
The container itself does NOT have an IP Address, because without root privileges, network association is not allowed.
You will also see some other limitations.

---------------
By default, ROOTFULL containers use the CNI bridge plugin for its default configuration.
In this case, NO NETWORK NAME must be passed to Podman.

However, you can create additional bridged networks with the podman create command.
In that case, you will have to set the network name.

The following example shows how to set up a web server and expose it to the network outside the host as rootless.
It will also show how an outside client can connect to the container.

(rootfull) $ sudo podman run -dt --name webserver -p 8080:80 quay.io/libpod/banner
00f3440c7576aae2d5b193c40513c29c7964e96bf797cf0cc352c2b68ccbe66a

# For ROOTLESS containers using CNI, a network must first be created.
$ podman network create
/home/user1/.config/cni/net.d/cni-podman1.conflist

# Now run the container.
$ podman run -dt --name webserver --net cni-podman1 -p 8081:80 quay.io/libpod/banner
269fd0d6b2c8ed60f2ca41d7beceec2471d72fb9a33aa8ca45b81dc9a0abbb12

Note in the above run command, the container's port 80 (where the Nginx server is running) was mapped to the host's port 8080.
Port 8080 was chosen to demonstrate how the host and container ports can be mapped for external access.
The port could very well have been 80 as well (except for rootless users).

To connect from an outside client to the webserver, simply point an HTTP client to the host's IP address at port 8080 for rootfull and port 8081 for rootless.
---------------


## Publishing Ports
Port publishing as rootless containers can be done for "HIGH PORTS" only.
All ports below 1024 are privileged and cannot be used for publishing.

#Instead of:
$ podman run -dt -p 80:8080/tcp registry.fedoraproject.org/f29/httpd

#Use:
$ podman run -dt -p 8080:8080/tcp registry.fedoraproject.org/f29/httpd

Note: You can also use podman -P to automatically publish and map ports.

## Container <-> Host Communication

If you want to reach a rootless container from your localhost, you can use port publishing (as in the example above).

# Check the ports published and occupied:
$ podman port -l
8080/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:8080

Note: The -l is a convenience argument for latest container.
You can also use the container's ID or name instead of -l or the long argument --latest.


## Container <-> Container Communication

Communicating between two rootless containers can be achieved in multiple ways.
The easiest and most convenient way is to communicate via PUBLISHED PORTS and the UNDERLYING HOST.

# Check if a "listening” container is running:
$ podman ps

# View the published ports:
$ podman port <container_id>

# View the address of your host:
$ ip addr

# Start a new container to contact your host + the published port:
$ podman run -it --rm fedora curl <Host_IP_Address>:<Published_Port>



##### ROOTFULL NETWORKING #####
This section describes how networking can be used in rootfull containers.

-----
ROOTFULL containers use the CNI bridge plugin for its default configuration.
In this case, no network name must be passed to Podman.
However, you can create additional bridged networks with the podman create command.
In that case, you will have to set the network name.

The following example shows how to set up a web server and expose it to the network outside the host as both rootfull and rootless.
It will also show how an outside client can connect to the container.

(rootfull) $ sudo podman run -dt --name webserver -p 8080:80 quay.io/libpod/banner
-----


## Publishing Ports
Port publishing works the same way as rootless containers, but you will be able to use PRIVILEGED PORTS, as long as they are free.

$ sudo podman run -dt -p 80:8080/tcp registry.fedoraproject.org/f29/httpd

Note: You can also use podman -P to automatically publish and map ports.


## Container <-> Host Communication
Rootfull containers are reachable via their published ports.

# Check which ports are published:
$ sudo podman port -l
8080/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:80

# Test from local machine:
$ curl localhost


## Container <-> Container Communication
Rootfull containers can communicate via their IP Address in the same network.

$ sudo podman inspect <container_id> | grep IPAddress
            "IPAddress": "10.88.0.83",

$ sudo podman run -it --rm fedora curl <Container_IP_Address>:<Container_Port>


## Configuring Networking
The installation of Podman provides a default network configuration commonly installed in /etc/cni/net.d/ as 87-podman-bridge.conflist.
The default network name is defined in /usr/share/containers/libpod.conf.
If you want to change the default network, you should copy the libpod.conf to /etc/containers/libpod.conf and change the new file.

To create a new network, you can use the podman network create command, which will create a new file in /etc/cni/net.d/.

## Using DNS in Container Networks
Podman provides a convenient way to allocate local DNS records to containers via the dnsname plugin.
This can become handy, if you want to communicate between 2 or more containers.

The feature will be automatically enabled for newly created networks via podman network create.
If you want to add this feature to the default network, you can either:
(1) Create a new network and make it default or 
(2) Add the needed lines to cat /etc/cni/net.d/87-podman-bridge.conflist - a reboot may be required.

}


--------------------------------


## Step 1 ##

# View the container images available.

[root@podman ~]# podman images
REPOSITORY                         TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED      SIZE
registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24  latest  b49449b8ae18  10 days ago  436 MB

There is one container available in the local (localhost) repository: rhel8/httpd-24
If there were multiple updated iterations of the conatiner available, you would use the IMAGE ID to work with those that are not tagged as latest.
Also, from this list you are able to see the size, on disk, of the container image.

------------------------

## Step 2 ##

The rhel8-httpd container includes a bash shell.
Deploy the container in an interactive fashion, which will allow you to run commands within the deployed container.
[root@podman ~]# podman run -it registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24 /bin/bash
bash-4.4$

# Notice that all of the filesystem contents are either memory-based (tmpfs, shm) or the overlay file associated with this runtime of the container image (overlay).

bash-4.4$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
overlay          17G  2.9G   15G  17% /
tmpfs            64M     0   64M   0% /dev
tmpfs           897M  9.0M  888M   1% /etc/hosts
shm              63M     0   63M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           897M     0  897M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup


# In another terminal:

root@podman ~]# podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                              COMMAND    CREATED             STATUS                 PORTS   NAMES
2a2000c8cb29  registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24  /bin/bash  About a minute ago  Up About a minute ago          ecstatic_cartwright


------------------------

## Step 3 ##

Exit the container's shell
exit

When the process on an interactive container is closed, the container stops running.

[root@podman ~]# podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                              COMMAND    CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS   NAMES
2a2000c8cb29  registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24  /bin/bash  About a minute ago  Exited (0) 3 seconds ago          ecstatic_cartwright

STATUS field = Exited
A container in this state can be resumed.

Remove container:

podman rm $(podman ps -a | grep Exited | cut -d" " -f1)
-or-
podman rm $(podman ps -a | grep Exited | awk {'print $1'})

------------------------

## Step 4 ##

Create a new instance of this container in a detached mode.
Configure port forwarding for the Apache web server so that connections to the host's port 8084 will redirect to the running container's port 80 (Apache service).

[root@podman ~]# podman run -dt -p 8080:80/tcp registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24
f5478a83ffd0a3a098306aa8ca7956b14be0e2ebb49b31fc517594ded5e92992


# Verify:
[root@podman ~]# podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                              COMMAND               CREATED         STATUS             PORTS                 NAMES
f5478a83ffd0  registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24  /usr/bin/run-http...  17 seconds ago  Up 17 seconds ago  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  nostalgic_jang
 
Observe that STATUS = Up and there is a new section in the output: PORTS that indicates the port forwarding defined for the container.


------------------------

## Step 5 ##

Unlike interactive containers, detached containers are stopped using podman stop .

podman stop $(podman ps -a | grep Up | cut -d" " -f1)
-or-
podman stop $(podman ps -a | grep Up | awk {'print $1'})

# Verify:
[root@podman ~]# podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                              COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS                     PORTS                 NAMES
498d6b63862c  registry.redhat.io/rhel8/httpd-24  /usr/bin/run-http...  4 minutes ago  Exited (0) 14 seconds ago  0.0.0.0:8090->80/tcp  modest_goodall

PODMAN GENERATE

Podman lets you generate Kubernetes DEFINITIONS from the existing runtime.
E.g. if you have a running container, you can use 'podman generate' to create a YAML file to define that container.
You can also do that with a pod.
So, I manually defined one of my WordPress sites in Podman.

Here are a few notes on that process.

## Mapping ports

In the Docker world, ports are mapped to containers.
That's true in Podman as well—except when you're running inside a pod.
See, the pod is like a container of containers.
Networking within the pod is more similar to networking within a host OS.
Pods reach each other over the local host, and external networking reaches the pod, not the containers directly.
When you run containers in a pod, you need to map ports on the pod like you would on the container in Docker or 'docker-compose'.
I also found that, although one of the benefits to Podman is the ability to run as a standard user,
I had to do all of this as root because of some security problems I ran into when I created the pods.
The problems were mainly centered around SELinux.

## Create a pod:
# Create a pod with port 8080 mapped to inside port 80.
# If you then spin up a container listening on port 80, you'd have connectivity.
[devops@podman PODS]$ sudo podman pod create --name my-pod -p 8080:80

## Create a container in the pod

To create a container in the pod, use podman run, but DON'T MAP A PORT.
This makes more sense when you have more than one container to work with, so I'm going to create a database container and then a WordPress container.

$ sudo podman run \
-d --restart=always --pod=my-pod \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="myrootpass" \
-e MYSQL_DATABASE="wp" \
-e MYSQL_USER="wordpress" \
-e MYSQL_PASSWORD="w0rdpr3ss" \
--name=wptest-db mariadb


$ sudo podman run \
-d --restart=always --pod=my-pod \
-e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME="wp" \
-e WORDPRESS_DB_USER="wordpress" \
-e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD="w0rdpr3ss" \
-e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST="127.0.0.1" \
--name wptest-web wordpress


Notice that I pointed the WORDPRESS_DB_HOST in the env: to LOCALHOST.
That's because the WordPress container is going to find the database container on the local host.
Our pod has three containers.
We ran two, but the third is the container that does the pod magic.


[devops@podman PODS]$ sudo podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                               COMMAND               CREATED             STATUS                 PORTS                 NAMES
