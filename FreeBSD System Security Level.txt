FreeBSD System Security Level
-----------------------------
The five Kernel SecureLevels are given in the init(8) manpage:

-1 Permanently insecure mode - Always run the system in level 0 mode. (Default initial value)

0 Insecure mode - Immutable and append-only flags may be turned off. All devices may be read or written subject to their permissions.

1 Secure mode - the system immutable and system append-only flags may not be turned off; disks for mounted file systems, /dev/mem, /dev/kmem and /dev/io (if your platform has it) may not be opened for writing; kernel modules (see kld(4)) may not be loaded or unloaded.

2 Highly secure mode - same as secure mode, plus disks may not be opened for writing (except by mount(2)) whether mounted or not. This level precludes tampering with file systems by unmounting them, but also inhibits running newfs(8) while the system is multi-user. In addition, kernel time changes are restricted to less than or equal to one second. Attempts to change the time by more than this amount will log the message ``Time adjustment clamped to +1 second''.

3 Network secure mode - same as highly secure mode, plus IP packet filter rules (see ipfw(8), ipfirewall(4) and pfctl(8)) cannot be changed and dummynet(4) or pf(4) configuration cannot be adjusted.

------------

View current secure level via sysctl:

# sysctl kern.securelevel
kern.securelevel: -1

Run these 2 commands to add the following lines to rc.conf
This will cause the system to set a securelevel of 2 on the next boot:

# sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf kern_securelevel_enable="YES"
kern_securelevel_enable: NO -> YES

# sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf kern_securelevel="2"
kern_securelevel: -1 -> 2
