# Limitations of kpatch
The kpatch feature is not a general-purpose kernel upgrade mechanism.
It is used for applying simple security and bug fix updates when rebooting the system is not immediately possible.

Do not use the SystemTap or kprobe tools during or after loading a patch.
The patch could fail to take effect until after such probes have been removed.
