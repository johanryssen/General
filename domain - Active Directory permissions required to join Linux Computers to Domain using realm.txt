Active Directory permissions required to join Linux Computers to Domain using realm.

# Issue
What are the list of permissions required in order to allow Active Directory service account to join Linux computers to Active Directory.

Command
"realm join example.com --user=domain-join-service" fails with error
"Insufficient permissions to join the domain example.com".

# Resolution
Microsoft AD requires certain permissions as discussed below, for a service account to join Linux computers while using realm and adcli.
The account should have delegation control of objects in the appropriate Computers container in Active Directory.
In order to differentiate Linux hosts from other AD-joined computers, create a custom Linux folder in AD.

# On the object types:
* Computer
Account shall have following permissions on this object.

# (Standard permissions required for joining all systems to an AD)
