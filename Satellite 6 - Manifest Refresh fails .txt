# Manifest Refresh fails 

- Satellite web UI > Monitor > Tasks
- Open the Refresh Manifest task which is stopped with warning.

- Click on the Dynflow Console button, go to that tab called Run and expand the first action by the name: 
'Actions::Candlepin::Owner::UpstreamUpdate' and look for the field 'expiration'

serial:
  created: '2019-01-24T12:38:00+0000'
  updated: '2019-06-04T11:17:04+0000'
  id: 4251147710546321896
  serial: 4251147710546321896
expiration: '2020-01-24T12:38:00+0000'
  collected: false
  revoked: false


As It can be observed, the expiration date is set to 2020-01-24 in the example output, which means after that date any attempt of refreshing the manifest will fail and that will also affect the repository synchronization tasks as well.
