## STEP 1 - Update and upgrade CentOS 7
yum -y update
yum -y install yum-plugin-fastestmirror


## STEP 2 - Checking kernel version
cat /etc/redhat-release
cat /etc/os-release
uname -msr


## STEP 3 - Add ELRepo Repository
Before installing new kernel version, we need to add new repository ELRepo repository.
That's because we want to use the kernel version from the ELRepo community.

Add ELRepo gpg key to the system.
rpm --import https://www.elrepo.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-elrepo.org

Now add new ELRepo repository with rpm command.
rpm -Uvh http://www.elrepo.org/elrepo-release-7.0-2.el7.elrepo.noarch.rpm

Check all repositories enabled on the system, and make sure ELRepo is on the list.
yum repolist


## STEP 4 - Install new Kernel version
yum --enablerepo=elrepo-kernel install kernel-ml
--enablerepo is an option to enable specific repository on CentOS system.
By default, 'elrepo' repository is enabled, but for our case, we needed 'elrepo-kernel'.

Check all of the available repositories on the system (enabled as well as disabled)
yum repolist all


## STEP 5 - Configure Grub2 CentOS 7
Make the new kernel the default (when the system is starting).

Check all available kernel versions with the awk command below.
sudo awk -F\' '$1=="menuentry " {print i++ " : " $2}' /etc/grub2.cfg

In the output, you'll see that we've two kernel versions - 3.10 and 4.11.2.
We want to use kernel 4.11 as our default, so you can use the following command to make this happen.
sudo grub2-set-default 0

When you want to revert back to the old kernel, you can change the value of the grub2-set-default command to 1.

Then generate the grub2 config with 'gurb2-mkconfig' command, and then reboot the server.
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
sudo reboot

uname -msr


## STEP 6 - Remove old kernel (optional)
For this purpose, we need to install the yum-utils utility from the repository.
yum install yum-utils

Now clean your old kernel with the following command.
package-cleanup --oldkernels
