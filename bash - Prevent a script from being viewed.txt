1. create your script:
vim readit.sh.protected
     #!/bin/bash
     echo 'This is from the no-read script'

2. Disallow read access and make executable:
chmod 111 readit.sh.protected

3. Create the proxy script:
vim readit.sh
     #!/bin/bash
     sudo $0.protected $@

Using $0 means that it should find the protected script down the same way it found your open script.

4. make executable
chmod +x readit.sh

5. Run the proxy script
./readit.sh

6. You will be prompted for you password, make sure the user is in /etc/sudoers

7. Although, this is a workaround:
sudo cat readit.sh.protected
