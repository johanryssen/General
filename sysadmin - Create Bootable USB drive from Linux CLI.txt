Create Bootable USB drive from Linux CLI


1. Insert USB key.
2. Get the device name
fdisk -l

3. Unmount:
umount /dev/sdb*

4. Create fat filesystem:
mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb -I

5. Write ISO to USB:
(Please use 'screen' or 'tmux' session since this will take a long time to complete)
dd bs=4M if=/ISO/OracleLinux-R7-U9-Server-x86_64-dvd.iso of=/dev/sdb status=progress oflag=sync


6. If "status=process" is not supported - View progress (at a this point in time)

a. Open a 2nd terminal window.

b. Get the pid of 'dd' process.
# pgrep -l '^dd$'
12345 dd

c. Send USR1 signal to the 'dd' process
# kill -USR1 12345

d. Return to the 1st terminal to view the progress.
Repeat step 6 to view the progress again.
