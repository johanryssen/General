----- SYNTAX 1 -----

find [path] [arguments] -exec [command] {} \;

[command] is what you want to execute over results given by the find command (eg. rm).

{} is a placeholder that is used to hold results given by the find command.

\; says that for each found result, the [command] is executed.
You need to escape the ; here and hence \;

----- SYNTAX 2 -----

# find [path] [arguments] -exec [command] {} +

Here, + says for every result of the find command, the [command] is executed only once.
All the results are passed to the [command] as arguments together. + does not need to be escaped with \+.


----- Diff between: {} \; and {} + -----

{} \;	-->		Executing the commands for EACH found result

ls file1.txt
ls file2.txt
ls file3.txt


{} +	-->		Executing the command once with all results argument

ls file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt


----- Examples -----

1. Find and display file attributes
Display all the lock files that are under the /tmp directory and display their properties.

sudo find /tmp/ -type f -name *lock -exec ls -l {} \;


2. Find and rename files

sudo find /home/user21/Downloads/ -type f -name 'ubuntu*' -exec mv {} {}_renamed \;

The above command finds the files that start with the name ubuntu and store them inside the placeholder {}.
Then adds "_renamed" at the end of each file stored inside the placeholder.



3. Collect and store file sizes

sudo find /tmp/ -type f -exec du -sh {} \; > /root/du_data.out


4. Change the ownership of files and directories

Find files owned by user21 and then change their ownership to user43.

sudo find /home/user21/disk/Downloads -user user21 -type f -exec chown user43 {} \;



5. Changing the permission of files

sudo find /home/user21/disk/Downloads -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

Use: -type f so the command will only be applied to files under the given directory.


6. Combine exec with grep Command

The find command works on the file names.
The grep command works on the contents of the files.

find - Search for all the files that have .hbs extension.
grep - search inside the content of those .hbs files for the string 'excerpt'.

find . -type f -name "*.hbs" -exec grep -iH excerpt {} \;

With the -H option, grep command will show the file names for each match:

user21@LHB:~/Downloads/casper-hyvor$ find . -type f -name "*.hbs" -exec grep -iH excerpt {} \;
./author.hbs:                <div class="post-card-excerpt">{{bio}}</div>
./partials/post-card.hbs:            {{#if excerpt}}
./partials/post-card.hbs:                <div class="post-card-excerpt">{{excerpt}}</div>
./post.hbs:        {{#if custom_excerpt}}
./post.hbs:            <p class="article-excerpt">{{custom_excerpt}}</p>
./tag.hbs:                <div class="post-card-excerpt">



7. Find with multiple exec commands

find . -type f -name "*.hbs" -exec echo {} \; -exec grep excerpt {} \;

Search for the .hbs files first
then echo their name with first exec command.
then, those files will be searched for the "excerpt" string.
