# Access NFS from Windows

1. Powershell
2. Run the appropriate command for your situation:
Server OS: Install-WindowsFeature NFS-Client
Desktop OS: Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName ServicesForNFS-ClientOnly, ClientForNFS-Infrastructure -Online -NoRestart

3. Mount the share using the following command, after making the required modifications:
mount -o anon nfs.share.server.name:/share-name X:

cmd> mount -o anon \\10.10.10.123\mnt\nfs Z:


------------

# Enable Write Permissions for the Anonymous User

1. egEdit:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ClientForNFS\CurrentVersion\Default

2. Create a new New DWORD (32-bit) Value inside the Default folder named:
AnonymousUid
and assign the UID found on the UNIX directory as shared by the NFS system.

3. Create a new New DWORD (32-bit) Value inside the Default folder named:
AnonymousGid
and assign the GID found on the UNIX directory as shared by the NFS system.

4. Restart the NFS client or reboot the machine to apply the changes.

5. The output of the mount command should now look like this:

Local    Remote                                 Properties
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Z:       \\10.10.10.123\mnt\nfs                   UID=0, GID=0

...

Notice the 0 value applied to the UID and GID.
This means the share is mounted using the root user.
