########

The contents of the SSH client config file is organized into stanzas (sections).
Each stanza starts with the Host directive and contains specific SSH options used when establishing a connection with the remote SSH server.

The Host directive can contain one pattern or a whitespace-separated list of patterns.
Each pattern can contain zero or more non-whitespace character or one of the following pattern specifiers:

* - Matches zero or more characters.
For example, Host * matches all hosts, while 192.168.0.* matches hosts in the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet.
? - Matches exactly one character.
The pattern, Host 10.10.0.? matches all hosts in 10.10.0.[0-9] range.
! - When used at the start of a pattern, it negates the match.
For example, Host 10.10.0.* !10.10.0.5 matches any host in the 10.10.0.0/24 subnet except 10.10.0.5.

The SSH client reads the configuration file stanza by stanza, and if more than one patterns match, the options from the FIRST matching stanza take precedence.
Therefore more host-specific declarations should be given at the beginning of the file, and more general overrides at the end of the file.


---------- Example 1 ----------
ssh user01@server1.test.lab -p 2255

----------
Above is equivalent to:
----------

# CMD:
ssh sv1

# ~/.ssh/config
Host sv1
HostName server1.test.lab
User user01
Port 2255
###

# Override option for "User":
ssh -o "User=root" sv1


---------- Example 2 ----------
Host yggdrasil
	HostName 10.10.8.14
	User vidarr
	Port 4321
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/yggdrasil.key

Host njordur
	HostName 10.10.12.44

Host baldur
	HostName 10.10.28.162

Host *dur
	user mimir

Host * !baldur
	LogLevel INFO

Host *
	User root
	Compression yes

---------- Explained ----------

## When you type 'ssh yggdrasil', the ssh client reads the file and apply the options from the first match, which is Host yggdrasil.
Then it checks the next stanzas one by one for a matching pattern.
The next matching one is 'Host * !baldur' (meaning all hosts except baldur), and it will apply the connection option from this stanza.
The last definition 'Host *' also matches, but the ssh client will take only the Compression option because the User option is already defined in the Host yggdrasil stanza.

# The full list of options used when you type ssh yggdrasil is as follows:
HostName 10.10.8.14
User vidarr
Port 4321
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/yggdrasil.key
LogLevel INFO
Compression yes

----------
## When running 'ssh njordur' the matching host patterns are:
Host njordur
Host *dur
Host * !baldur
Host *.

# The options used in this case are:
HostName 10.10.12.44
User mimir
LogLevel INFO
Compression yes

----------
If you run ssh baldur, the matching host patterns are:
Host baldur
Host *dur
Host *.

# The options used in this case are:
HostName 10.10.28.162
User mimir
Compression yes

----------
For all other connections, the ssh client will use the options specified in the Host * !baldur and Host * sections
----------

# SSH client reads its configuration in the following order:
1. Options specified from the command line
2. Options defined in the ~/.ssh/config
3. Options defined in the /etc/ssh/ssh_config
