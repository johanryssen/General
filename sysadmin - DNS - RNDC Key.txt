# RNDC - Remote Name Daemon Control - Name server control utility in bind.

Allows command line administration of the named service both locally and remotely.
Controls the operation of a name server.
RNDC config file specifies which server controls and what algorithm the server should use.

To prevent unauthorized users to the named daemon, BIND uses a shared secret key authentication method to grant privileges to particular hosts.
It means that an identical key must be present in the configuration file of bind, /etc/named.conf and configuration file, /etc/rndc.conf.

RNDC uses a TCP connection to communicate with the name server.

------------------------------

(0) Stop named
systemctl stop named


(1) To configure and link new keys:
Remove the auto-generated /etc/rndc.key file.
mv /etc/rndc.key{,-BACKUP}


(2) Create a new RNDC key and link it to the named configuration using rndc-confgen.
(2.1) Generate an rndc key and configuration file. 

[root@server1 etc]# rndc-confgen -r /dev/urandom | tee /etc/rndc.conf

# Start of rndc.conf
key "rndc-key" {
        algorithm hmac-md5;
        secret "PjmSrk6WELfckJSQ2cLj9A==";
};

options {
        default-key "rndc-key";
        default-server 127.0.0.1;
        default-port 953;
};
# End of rndc.conf

# Use with the following in named.conf, adjusting the allow list as needed:
# key "rndc-key" {
#       algorithm hmac-md5;
#       secret "PjmSrk6WELfckJSQ2cLj9A==";
# };
#
# controls {
#       inet 127.0.0.1 port 953
#               allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { "rndc-key"; };
# };
# End of named.conf


(2.2) Copy the "key" section to /etc/rndc.key
cat << EOF > /etc/rndc.key
key "rndc-key" {
        algorithm hmac-md5;
        secret "PjmSrk6WELfckJSQ2cLj9A==";
};
EOF


(2.3) Copy the last section to named.conf
Paste the copied section into '/etc/named.conf' just before the 'include' statements and delete the # signs at the beginning of the lines.

# vim /etc/named.conf
key "rndc-key" {
      algorithm hmac-md5;
      secret "PjmSrk6WELfckJSQ2cLj9A==";
};

controls {
      inet 127.0.0.1 port 953
              allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { "rndc-key"; };
};

include "/etc/named.rfc1912.zones";
include "/etc/named.root.key";


(3) Check SELinux permissions 
restorecon -vvRF /etc/rndc.key
ls -alZ /etc/rndc.key

USER: root
GROUP: named 
SELinux: system_u:object_r:dnssec_t:s0

# Correct the file permissions:

# setsebool -P named_write_master_zones on
# chmod g+w /var/named
# chown named:named /etc/rndc.conf
# chown named:named /etc/rndc.key
# chmod 600 /etc/rndc.key



(4) Check & start named
named-checkconf /etc/named.conf
systemctl start named


(5) Reload RNDC:
rndc -V reload
...
server reload successful


(6) rndc status
# rndc status
...
server is up and running


(7) Use the nslookup utility to verify that DNS records are being cached on localhost.
# nslookup www.google.com 127.0.0.1
Server:         127.0.0.1
Address:        127.0.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   www.google.com
Address: 172.253.115.104
Name:   www.google.com
Address: 172.253.115.106



ss -lnptu | grep named
