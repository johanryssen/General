---------- Shutdown and Start sequence steps of Oracle RAC components ----------

1. Stop Oracle RAC 12c

Perform these steps in the order listed:

srvctl stop listener [-listener listener_name] [-node node_name] [-force] (stops all listener services)
srvctl stop database -db db_unique_name [-stopoption stop_options] [-eval(12c only)] [-force] [-verbose]
srvctl stop asm [-proxy] [-node node_name] [-stopoption stop_options] [-force]
srvctl stop nodeapps [-node node_name] [-gsdonly] [-adminhelper] [-force] [-relocate] [-verbose]
crsctl stop crs
	

2. Start Oracle RAC 12c

Perform these steps in the order listed:

1. crsctl start crs
2. crsctl start res ora.crsd -init
3. srvctl start nodeapps [-node node_name] [-gsdonly] [-adminhelper] [-verbose]
4. srvctl start asm [-proxy] [-node node_name [-startoption start_options]]
5. srvctl start database -db db_unique_name [-eval(12c only)]] [-startoption start_options] [-node node_name]
6. srvctl start listener [-node node_name] [-listener listener_name] (start all listener services)

To start resources of your HA environment if that are still down (e.g. ora.ons, Listener):
crsctl start resource -all


3. Debug
The log and trace files of the clusterware files are stored in the Automatic Diagnostic Repository (ADR) under the ADR_HOME location:
$ADR_BASE/diag/crs/`hostname`/crs

$ adrci
adrci> show homes


---------- Manage low level cluster resources: CRS, HAS, cluster ----------


## crs_stat

-t	Tabular form
-a	allows a specific resource_name to be entered 
-g	Returns 0 if the resource is registered with clusterware, 1 if it is not 
-r	Returns 0 if the resource is running currently, and 1 if it is not
	- May also be combined with -c cluster_node to narrow the query to a specific node
-p	Prints the profile of any resource
-f	Extended information and the profile
-ls	Lists resources along with their owners and permissions
	- May include a resource_name
-v	Extended information including failover counts


1. "Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control" Agent Status:
# USER: oracle
export PATH=/u02/app/oracle/product/agent/13.2.0.0/agent_inst/bin/:$PATH
emctl status agent


2. Start all resources across a cluster
crs_start -all

# If the -all option is not specified, a resource name must be given, eg:
crs_start ora.racnode1.vip


3. Find offline resources:
crs_stat -t | grep -i offline

# List each resource registered with clusterware and show its status
crs_stat


4. Clusterware Resource Status:
## USER: grid
ocrcheck

crsctl stat res -t
## -or shorter-
crsctl stat res -t


5. Check the current status of a cluster:
crsctl check cluster

# Display cluster name:
olsnodes -c


6. Current status of CRS
crsctl check crs


7. Stop/Start the local node
crsctl stop has

This command will also abort the database and CRS.
Local Listeners will stop and VIP listeners will migrate elsewhere.

# Start all the CRS components, listeners and the database.
crsctl start has


8. Stop/Start the whole cluster

crsctl stop cluster -all
crsctl start cluster -all


9. Start and stop oracle clusterware (CRS)

crsctl stop crs
crsctl start crs


---------- Manage Network components ----------


1. Display global public and global cluster_interconnect

C:\Windows\system32>oifcfg ge34f

Heartbeat 192.168.67.0 global cluster_interconnect,asm
Production 10.20.30.0 global public


2. Check if nodeapps running on a node

srvctl status nodeapps [-n my-node]

For each VIP address: network enabled/disabled, running on node host1 or not running.

Nodeapps are standard set of oracle application services which are started automatically for RAC.

Node apps Include:
1) VIP
2) Oracle Net listeners
3) Global Service Daemon
4) Oracle Notification Service (ONS).

Nodeapp Services run on each node of the cluster.
They switch over to other nodes through VIP during a failover.


3. Check the SCAN Configuration

The SCAN makes it possible to add or remove nodes from the cluster without needing to reconfigure clients.

Using CLUVFY to Confirm DNS is Correctly Associating the SCAN addresses.

cluvfy comp scan
Verifying Single Client Access Name (SCAN) …PASSED
Verification of SCAN was successful.
CVU operation performed: SCAN
Date: Oct 19, 2017 1:17:59 PM
CVU home: C:\…\grid_home\bin\..\
User: .\VFENOLL


4. Display the current configuration of the SCAN VIPs

srvctl config scan

SCAN name: MY-CLUSTER-SCAN, Network: 1
Subnet IPv4: 10.40.50.0/255.255.255.0/Production, static
Subnet IPv6:
SCAN 1 IPv4 VIP: 10.55.66.77
...


5. Display the status of SCAN VIPs and SCAN listeners

srvctl status scan


Add or modify a scan VIP:
srvctl add | modify scan -n my-scan

To delete it:
srvctl remove scan


6. Display the status of SCAN listeners

srvctl status scan_listener


Add or remove a scan_listener:
srvctl add | remove scan_listener

To change the port:
srvctl modify scan_listener -p


---------- Manage the Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR) ----------


1. Verify the integrity of OCR

cluvfy comp ocr -n all -verbose


2. Backup the OCR

Oracle takes physical backup of OCR automatically every 3 hours.
Default location is:
CRS_home/cdata/my_cluster_name/OCRBackup

The ocrconfig tool is used to make daily copies of the automatically generated backup files.

Show backups:
ocrconfig -showbackup

Change default location of physical OCR copies:
ocrconfig -backuploc

After that, you have to copy these files on tape or in another backup location:
cp -p -R CRS_home/cdata/my_cluster_name /u03/backups

To do a manual backup:
ocrconfig -export /u03/backups/exports/OCR_exportBackup.dmp


3. Recover OCR from physical or export backup

Pre-requisite:
All RAC components shutdow

Recover OCR from automatic physical backups:
crconfig -restore CRS_home/cdata/my_cluster_name/OCRBackup/backup00.ocr

Recover OCR from export backup:
ocrconfig -import /u03/backups/exports/OCR_exportBackup.dmp


4. Backup the Voting disks

In older versions of Oracle Clusterware you have to backup voting disks with the dd command.
Starting with Oracle Clusterware 11g Release 2 you no longer need to backup them.
Voting disks are automatically backed up as a part of the OCR.



----------  Manage database components ----------

1. find the name of the database

This name is useful as it is used in RAC commands with -d parameter.

# With SQL*Plus:
connect / as sysdba
show parameter db_unique_name

# With crsctl:
crsctl status resource -t | grep db


2. Inspect the database configuration

srvctl config database -d my-db-name


3. Display the name and the status of the instances in the RAC

srvctl status database -d my-db-name

# To list just active nodes:
olsnodes -s –t


4. Start|stop the database

srvctl stop database -d my-db-name -o immediate
srvctl start database -d my-db-name


5. Start|stop one instance of the RAC

srvctl start instance -d my-db-name -i my-db-name1
srvctl stop instance -d my-db-name -i my-db-name1

Use -force if the instance to stop is not on the local server


6. Start and stop a PDB in Oracle RAC

# Stop a PDB (Pluggable DataBase)

On the current node [or on all the nodes]:

ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE my-PDB-name CLOSE IMMEDIATE [Instances=all];

This will stop the associated service too.
Manually stopping the associated service will not close the PDB.
You have to use this SQL command.


# Start a PDB

On the current node [or on all the nodes]:

ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE my-PDB-name OPEN [Instances=all;]

You can also start the PDB with the associated service
This will NOT start the service(s) associated with this PDB.


7. Stop and start a Listener

srvctl stop listener -l LISTENER_NAME
srvctl start listener -l LISTENER_NAME
