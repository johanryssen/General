Forwarding one port to another


To forward a TCP port from your local workstation to another host.
(Used for debugging purposes):

mkfifo pipe ; cat pipe | nc -l 8080 | nc google.com 80 > pipe ; rm pipe

What this does:

1) Create a fifo (First in First out) file.
This is a very simple type of file,
you can put stuff in there with an output redirect (>) and get stuff out there with cat.
It acts as a temporary buffer.

2) Open that newly created pipe.
Anything that gets in, will be printed. (and forwarded in this example to "nc")

3) Open a listening port on your local workstation, listening on port 8080.

4) Open a connection to google.com, on port 80.

5) Send al the output to the earlier created pipe.

6) Remove the pipe when done.
