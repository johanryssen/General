WIFI & Lenovo & Linux

Some Lenovos have issues with the UEFI which is like a BIOS but cwstruggles with linux.
In this case you have to change out the grub 2 bootloader in ubuntu for grub legacy.

Another problem with some Lenovos is the wireless

# service network-manager stop
# rmmod acer_wmi
# modprobe acer_wmi
# rfkill unblock all
# service network-manager start
# rmmod -f acer_wmi

then to get the settings to stick after reboot type
# su -
# echo "blacklist acer_wmi" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
# exit

and you will have working WIFI.
