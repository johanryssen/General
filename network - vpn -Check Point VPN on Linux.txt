SSL Network Extender is a secure connectivity framework for remote access to a corporate network.
SSL Network Extender uses a thin VPN client installed on the user's remote computer that connects to an SSL-enabled web server.
The web server and the client are in the same VPN.
SSL Network Extender is downloaded automatically from the Mobile Access portal to the endpoint machines, so that client software does not have to be pre-installed and configured on users' PCs and laptops.
Remote users access the portal from a Web browser with
https://<Gateway_IP_address>/sslvpn, where <Gateway_IP_address> is one of these:
- FQDN that resolves to the IP address of the Security Gateway
- IP address of the Security Gateway

Remote users that use HTTP are automatically redirected to the portal using HTTPS.

Note: SSL Network Extender requires that Java is installed on the endpoint computer.
Java is not installed on Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion).
