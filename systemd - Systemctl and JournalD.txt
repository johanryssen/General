journalctl -k

# Limit this only to the current boot by appending the -b flag:
journalctl -k -b

journalctl -f -u apache2

# A unit file contains the parameters that systemd uses to manage and run a unit.
# See the full contents of a unit file:
systemctl cat nginx.service

# See the dependency tree of a unit (which units systemd will attempt to activate when starting the unit):
systemctl list-dependencies nginx.service

# This will show the dependent units, with target units recursively expanded.
# To expand all dependent units recursively, pass the --all flag:
systemctl list-dependencies --all nginx.service

# See the low-level details of the unit's settings on the system:
systemctl show nginx.service
